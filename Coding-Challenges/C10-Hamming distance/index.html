    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>Write a program to find the Hamming distance between two strings.</p>
    <p style="background-color: #eee;"><b>NOTE:</b> Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number
        of positions at which the corresponding characters are different. In more technical terms, it is a measure of
        the minimum number of changes required to turn one string into another.</p>
    <p>The Hamming distance between:</p>
    <pre>
    "karolin" and "kathrin" is 3.
    "karolin" and "kerstin" is 3.
    1011101 and 1001001 is 2.
    2173896 and 2233796 is 3.
